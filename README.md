< This project serves as practice for my current knowledge of HTML and CSS. >
< I had asked a friend of mine to borrow their pictures and create a one-page
photo portfolio using only HTML, CSS, CSS grid, and media queries>

<The main obstacles for me was getting my web page to appear how i want it to on mobile.
     the CSS grid was fine when it came to the media queries for mobile, however when it came to centering
     the pictures for the user, it did not come out how I want it to and kept experiencing bugs.>
< My weaknesses during this project would have to be my knowledge of using media queries. This concept was something I knew I couldn''t
    understand right away. So I wanted to implement it into this project, because I wanted to increase my knowledge of using media queries>
< My strong points would have to be utilizing the CSS grid. Once I was introduced to CSS grid, i was immediately intrigued and wanted to implement that 
    into my projects. Creating a photo portfolio was a great opportunity to practice both CSS grid and media queries>
  
  < Although I still have much much more to go, my confidence in designing and building has certainly improved. My only goal is to keep getting better
            and keep on learning>
