# Update 3/10/22
I've completely re-done the layout and design. The last version was not very well organized and needed a lot of improvements.
This design and layout is much more clean and the code as well. I am currently developing the mobile version of the site.





This project serves as practice for my current knowledge of HTML and CSS.
I had asked a friend of mine to borrow their pictures and create a one-page
photo portfolio using only HTML, CSS, CSS grid, and media queries.

As I learned more and more about CSS grid I became very intrigued with that style of designing.
Although there are people who prefer flexbox, CSS grid was the one I really wanted to implement and refine.

Therefore I decided to ask my good friend to use some of their pictures and create a small portfolio of it.
The pictures turned out really great and I had to do it, the practice was valuable.

creating a photo portfolio was a perfect opportunity to use CSS grid, in my opinion. 
Envisioning the layout came easily which got me excited.

The main obstacles in this project was figuring out the sizing of the columns and rows and how that relates to 
how the pictures will fit into each grid. 

The early stages was a lot of trial & error. I even took a break from it for a while and did some other 
challenges to help better understand how sizing containers really affect a web pages' content. 
However, it was thanks to those challenges that i was able to finally have a better grip on how i can size images 
and elements in a container. 

What improved:

The amount of useless code definitely lessened after realizing how I can concisely and properly fit images into the grid how I want it to.
Initially, the images WERE fitting, but they were not fitting the wat i WANTED it to.

Initially the layout of the web page was very bland and lacked personality. I thought about adding a nav bar, but it was really useless as there wasn't
enough content for it to require a nav bar, so that was deleted. The inital design was just:
"header"
"pictures pictures pictures pictures"
"about"
"contact"
All just straight down the middle-- I didn't like that. 
So i decided that i needed to change the layout of content and information to have appeal.

That's when I decided an L shaped page added that personality input to the page. I decided that
having an L shaped design of the photos and enclosed with information showed how much knowledge i have
when using CSS grids. Having things just go straight down the page would be way too generic. 

I thought that giving the reader a bit of "eye exercise" would grab their attention right away but not too much "eye exercise" that 
they're completely dizzied by the amount of angles and path the webpages made. 

Another challenge I wanted to improve on was the use of @media queries.

During my learning and study of CSS media queries I was really clueless on how to use it. It was through watching youtube and re-doing 
exercises and courses that I finally had a good, but not great, but still good, hold on the practice. 

So I wanted people to also access this portfolio through their phones and view it in a way that appeases the mobile user
This is also helped add to my experience in mobile web design and such experience is important to amass in today's age of phones.

Google web tool really helped me with this part of the project, it also exposed to how I can use this to my advantage even more as I make
more designs that has mobile users in mind.

When I'm asked to showcase a project I'm proud of this would be one of them.
Because it's the one that I actually created from scratch. 
It also exposed me to even more concepts and practices that made me excited to create better and bigger projects.

There is still MUCH more to add to this project. 
I can still see many areas to improve on, which i will implement of course.
For the time being and with my current knowledge, I think this is a great project that showcases my 
style of designing and way of thinking.
